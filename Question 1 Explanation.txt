To detect the presence of an omitted variable bias (OVB) using the output of your regression models, we need to analyze the differences between the two sets of regression results: one where the omitted variable (fatheduc) is included and one where it is not. Here are some key steps and observations:

Compare Coefficients:

When fatheduc is not included, the coefficient for log_faminc is 0.3062.
When fatheduc is included, the coefficient for log_faminc drops to 0.3011.
The change in the coefficient of log_faminc suggests that fatheduc has some explanatory power over log_bweight, which was previously being incorrectly attributed to log_faminc.

Changes in R-squared:

The R-squared value increases significantly from 0.310 to 0.864 when fatheduc is included in the model. This indicates that fatheduc explains a substantial portion of the variance in log_bweight that was not captured by log_faminc alone.

Changes in Standard Errors:

The standard error for log_faminc changes from 0.010 to 0.005. A reduction in the standard error suggests that the estimate for log_faminc is more precise when fatheduc is included, further indicating that the original model without fatheduc was likely misspecified.

Significance Levels:

The significance levels (P>|t|) for log_faminc are extremely low in both models, indicating that log_faminc is a statistically significant predictor in both cases. However, the inclusion of fatheduc provides a more accurate estimation.

Model Fit:

The AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) values are substantially lower when fatheduc is included, indicating a better model fit.
Detecting Omitted Variable Bias in Practice

To detect OVB in practice, follow these steps:

Initial Model Check:

Run the initial regression model and examine the residual plots. Check for patterns that suggest the presence of an omitted variable.
Look for variables that are likely correlated with both the independent and dependent variables.
Include Suspected Variables:

Run a second regression model including the suspected omitted variable(s).
Compare the coefficients, standard errors, R-squared values, and other model fit statistics between the two models.
Statistical Tests:

Conduct tests such as the Ramsey RESET test to detect misspecification errors that could be due to omitted variables.
Perform a variance inflation factor (VIF) analysis to check for multicollinearity which might indicate omitted variable issues.
Model Comparison:

Evaluate the changes in the coefficients of the original variables when the omitted variable is included. Significant changes suggest that the original model was biased.
Assess the overall fit of the model (R-squared, AIC, BIC) to see if the inclusion of the new variable improves the model significantly.

Regular vs. Robust Standard Errors:

Regular SE for log_faminc: 0.004510
Robust SE for log_faminc: 0.004529
The standard errors are quite similar, suggesting that heteroscedasticity might not be a severe issue in this case. However, using robust standard errors is a safeguard against potential violations of the homoscedasticity assumption.
Implications of Using Robust SE:

If the residuals were heteroscedastic, robust standard errors would provide more reliable estimates of the standard errors, leading to more valid inference (hypothesis tests, confidence intervals).
If the residuals were homoscedastic, using robust standard errors would not harm the inference but might slightly increase the standard errors.
Practical Considerations:
Detecting Omitted Variable Bias (OVB):

The comparison between the models with and without the father's education variable highlights the OVB. The significant difference in the R-squared values and the coefficients' changes indicate the presence of OVB when fatheduc is omitted.
In practice, residual plots, correlation tests, and theoretical considerations are used to detect and justify the inclusion of additional variables to mitigate OVB.
Economic Interpretation:

The effect of paternal education on birth weight is substantial and statistically significant, highlighting its importance in the model.
Policy implications could involve focusing on both income support and educational improvements to enhance child health outcomes.
